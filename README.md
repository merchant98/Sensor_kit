# Sensor_kit
Designing a kit to include all the sensors for educational purpose. Working on Raspberry-Pi 4 
Designing an App for easy interface 
The kit involves working with different types of sensors for:
Temperature (RTD(pt100), NTC 103, DHT-11, K-type Thermocouple, LM35)
Humidity (DHT-11)
Atmospheric Pressure (BMP180)
Light (LDR , Photodiode, Phototransistor, IR LED, IR Receiver)
Air Quality (Smoke Sensor)
LVDT (AC-AC)
Load Cell(10 Kg)
Proximity Switches(Capacitive and Inductive)
Laser Diode
ADC
